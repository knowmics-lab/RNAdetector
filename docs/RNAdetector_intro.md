# RNAdetector: a user friendly and stand-alone pipeline for RNA-Seq data analysis
***RNAdetector*** is a user-friendly pipeline for the analysis of protein-coding genes and ncRNAs from RNA-Seq data
## Performed analyses
***RNAdetector*** allows to perform several types of analysis such as:
- Quantification and normalization
- Differential expression analysis
- miRNA-sensitive topological pathway analysis
## Non-coding RNAs analyzed
In addition to mRNAs, ***RNAdetector*** can also analyze several classes of small and long ncRNAs.
##### Small non-coding RNAs
- micro RNAs (miRNAs)
- PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs)
- tRNA fragments (tRFS)
- tRNA derived small ncRNAs (tsRNAs)
##### Long non-coding RNAs
- long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
- transcribed UltraConserved Regions (tUCR)
- circular RNAs (circRNAs)

## Features
***RNAdetector*** has several important features such as:
- Easy installation and dependencies management 
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Completely off line
- Graphical reports with the results of the analyses
